### ðŸ“ˆ To Do

## Progress 6-21 

### âœ… Finished 
1. learned the syntax of GSQL (for TigerGraph) and Cypher (for Neo4j).
2. run LDBC SNB BI queries on TigerGraph.
### ðŸ‘· In Progress
1. implementing LDBC BI queries in addition to Q1, Q5 and Q6 in our system.
### ðŸ“ˆ To Do
1. to run LDBC BI queries on Neo4j.
2. to make our system support string filtering.
